Introduction

Kansas City, Missouri (KCMO) has a violent crime problem. It was on full display at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl Parade and Rally on February 15, 2024, in downtown KCMO.

February 11, 2024, the Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LVIII, their second such accomplishment in two years. If the franchise achieves a three-peat during the 2025 season, they will be the first National Football League (NFL) franchise in history to win three consecutive Super Bowla, a feat thought to be impossible with the parity in the NFL.


Just before 2pm, at the west end of Union Station, automatic gunfire erupted from within the massive crowd, then stopped abruptly. People ran screaming from the origin of the gunfire with live AP (2024) footage of the events showing the wave of panic spreading away from the epicenter like a water drop, not certain the direction to safety. The video also captured the compassion of Kansas City as members of the community risked their lives in the face of a rapidly devolving security environment to aid those who sustained injuries. KCPD would later release that Lisa Lopez-Galvan succumbed to her injuries, and eight other attendees who received serious injuries, including children (KCPD, 2024). This was not supposed to happen; not here, not today, not anywhere ever.

Violent crime is a problem in KCMO, but the city is not alone. Law enforcement around the world must adapt rapidly in the evolving threat environment. Smithsonian Magazine (2015) recognizes Howard Unruh as the first mass victim shooter in 1949, killing 13 people while wounding another three. The magazine reported that Unruh was the first “lone wolf actor,” 

The US has been acting out terror in schools, businesses, and residents’ terror Middle East have shown that violence pagers and walkie-talkies demonstrate that the ability to terrorize a population has evolved, yet again, to a level that shocked the world. The rhetoric in our own political arena does not guarantee a future with a stable democracy, threatening the leadership role of the US around the world. The random and senseless nature of Lisa’s death highlights the need for law enforcement to increase security efforts using new law enforcement tactics, increased personnel, and state-of-the-art security solutions to protect LPE and reduce violent crime in KCMO. While worldwide fans watched, France premier top notch security implementation at the 2024 Olympic Games without any major security incidents that would make world news. The games represented the best of bleeding edge security devices, software, and practices in securing LPE by using innovative technology, training, and practical experience combined against an unseen but omnipresent threat to life and liberty. As a trusted ally to the US, France shares the same elements of terrorism as the United States (US). One could speculate the two countries have had conversations related to the games.
